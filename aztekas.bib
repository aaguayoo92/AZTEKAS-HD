  Abstract                 = {Some of the most interesting scenarios that can be studied in astrophysics, contain fluids and plasma moving under the influence of strong gravitational fields. To study these problems it is required to implement numerical algorithms robust enough to deal with the equations describing such scenarios, which usually involve hydrodynamical shocks. It is traditional that the first problem a student willing to develop research in this area is to numerically solve the one dimensional Riemann problem, both Newtonian and relativistic. Even a more basic requirement is the construction of the exact solution to this problem in order to verify that the numerical implementations are correct. We describe in this paper the construction of the exact solution and a detailed procedure of its implementation.},

Secondly, we propose to use more accurate fluxes as the     building block. These are the HLLC and MUSTA fluxes [Multi-stage predictor–corrector fluxes for hyperbolic equations, 2003; Restoration of the contact surface in the HLL Riemann solver, Report CoA 9204, June     1992; J.

In this paper two improvements are discussed: a simple TVD Runge-Kutta type time discretization, and an ENO construction procedure based on fluxes rather tha    n on cell averages. These improvements simplify the schemes considerably-especially for multi-dimensional problems with forcing terms. Preliminary numerical results are also given."

    abstract = {In this article we develop a Primitive Variable Recovery Scheme (PVRS) to solve any system of coupled differential conservative equations. This method obtains directly the primitive variables     applying the chain rule to the time term of the conservative equations. With this, a traditional finite volume method for the flux is applied in order avoid violation of both, the entropy and “Rankine-Hugon    iot” jump conditions. The time evolution is then computed using a forward finite difference scheme. This numerical technique evades the recovery of the primitive vector by solving an algebraic system of equa    tions as it is often used and so, it generalises standard techniques to solve these kind of coupled systems. The article is presented bearing in mind special relativistic hydrodynamic numerical schemes with     an added pedagogical view in the appendix section in order to easily comprehend the PVRS. We present the convergence of the method for standard shock-tube problems of special relativistic hydrodynamics and a     graphical visualisation of the errors using the fluctuations of the numerical values with respect to exact analytic solutions. The PVRS circumvents the sometimes arduous computation that arises from standar    d numerical methods techniques, which obtain the desired primitive vector solution through an algebraic polynomial of the charges.},

We also discuss the calculation of primitive variables from conservative ones for the EOSs c    onsidered in the paper, and present the eigenstructure of relativistic hydrodynamics for a general EOS, in a way that they can be used to build numerical codes. Tests with a code based on the total variation     diminishing (TVD) scheme are presented to highlight the differences induced by different EOSs.}

 abstract="Owing to the strong link frequently observed between the carbuncle phenomenon and Quirk's problem, the stability of a shock wave propagating down a duct has been recently revisited (Robinet, 2000),     leading to the existence of an unstable mode which only occurs for a specific value of the upstream Mach number. The purpose of the present paper is to establish a relationship between the unstable mode giv    en by the stability theory and the carbuncle phenomenon. The numerical results suggest that the carbuncle phenomenon is not a pure numerical pathology  reveals an instability mechanism intrinsically assoc    iated to the Euler equations.",
